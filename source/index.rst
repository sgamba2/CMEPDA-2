Module: basic Python
	Assignment #4 (October 7, 2021)


	--- Goal
	Create a ProbabilityDensityFunction class that is capable of throwing
	preudo-random number with an arbitrary distribution.

	(In practice, start with something easy, like a triangular distribution---the
	initial debug will be easier if you know exactly what to expect.)


	--- Specifications
	- the signature of the constructor should be __init__(self, x, y), where
	  x and y are two numpy arrays sampling the pdf on a grid of values, that
	  you will use to build a spline
	- [optional] add more arguments to the constructor to control the creation
	  of the spline (e.g., its order)
	- the class should be able to evaluate itself on a generic point or array of
	  points
	- the class should be able to calculate the probability for the random
	  variable to be included in a generic interval
	- the class should be able to throw random numbers according to the distribution
	  that it represents
	- [optional] how many random numbers do you have to throw to hit the
	  numerical inaccuracy of your generator?
